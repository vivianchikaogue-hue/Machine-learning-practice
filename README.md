# Machine-learning-practice

## 📝 Project Summary
This project is a hands-on implementation of **Multivariate Linear Regression** developed in Google Colab. The goal was to build a predictive model that analyzes the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single target output.

## 🛠️ Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and performed feature scaling.
- **Modeling:** Trained a `Linear Regression` model using Scikit-Learn.

## 🚀 Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)

## 📊 Results
The model achieved an **R² score of 0.96**, demonstrating a strong linear relationship between the chosen features and the target variable.
